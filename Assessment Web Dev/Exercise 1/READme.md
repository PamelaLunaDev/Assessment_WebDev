# Exercise 1 - Semantic Markup

## Overview
This project is part of the Web Development I assessment.  
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple recipe web page using semantic HTML elements only.  
The focus is on structure, readability, and correct use of HTML tags, not visual or styling.  

## Task
I created a pancake recipe page and structure the content using semantic markup.  
The page includes:  
- Page title and description
- Ingredients list
- Step by step instructions
- External link to a recipe video
- Button to access more recipes
- Footer with author information

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 only

## Semantic Elements Used
The following semantic elements were implemented:
- header
- main
- section
- h1, h2
- p
- ol, ul, li
- a (Hyperlink)
- button
- footer

These elements help improve accessibility, readability, and page structure.
